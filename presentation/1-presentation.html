  <h1>Mythology</h1><br><br>
  <div class="box1"></div>

  <h2 id="preshome"></h2>
  <p>Myth is a folklore genre consisting of narratives that play a fundamental role in a society, such as foundational tales or origin myths. The main characters in myths are usually non-humans, such as gods, demigods, and other supernatural figures.[1][2][3][4] However, others also include humans, animals, or combinations in their classificiation of myth.[5] Stories of everyday human beings, although often of leaders of some type, are usually contained in legends, as opposed to myths.[1][4] Myths are sometimes distinguished from legends in that myths deal with gods, usually have no historical basis, and are set in a world of the remote past, very different from that of the present.[4][6]

    Myths are often endorsed by rulers and priests or priestesses and are closely linked to religion or spirituality.[7] Many societies group their myths, legends, and history together, considering myths and legends to be true accounts of their remote past.[7][2][8][9] In particular, creation myths take place in a primordial age when the world had not achieved its later form.[7][10][11] Other myths explain how a society's customs, institutions, and taboos were established and sanctified.[7][11] There is a complex relationship between recital of myths and the enactment of rituals.<br>
    
    The term mythology may either refer to the study of myths in general, or a body of myths regarding a particular subject.[12] The study of myth began in ancient history. Rival classes of the Greek myths by Euhemerus, Plato, and Sallustius were developed by the Neoplatonists and later revived by Renaissance mythographers. Today, the study of myth continues in a wide variety of academic fields, including folklore studies, philology, psychology, and anthropology.[13] Moreover, the academic comparisons of bodies of myth are known as comparative mythology.<br>
    
    Since the term myth is widely used to imply that a story is not objectively true, the identification of a narrative as a myth can be highly controversial: <u>many adherents of religions view their own religion's stories as true, and therefore object to those stories being characterized as myths, while seeing the stories of other religions as being myth.</u> As such, some scholars label all religious narratives as myths for practical reasons, such as to avoid depreciating any one tradition because cultures interpret each other differently relative to one another. <strong><i>Other scholars avoid using the term "myth" altogether and instead utilize different terms like "sacred history", "holy story", or simply "history" to avoid placing pejorative overtones on any sacred narrative.</i></strong> Definitions of myth vary to some extent among scholars, though Finnish folklorist Lauri Honko offers a widely-cited definition:<br>

    Myth, a story of the gods, a religious account of the beginning of the world, the creation, fundamental events, the exemplary deeds of the gods as a result of which the world, nature and culture were created together with all parts thereof and given their order, which still obtains. A myth expresses and confirms society's religious values and norms, it provides a pattern of behavior to be imitated, testifies to the efficacy of ritual with its practical ends and establishes the sanctity of cult.<br>
    
    Another definition of myth comes from myth criticism theorist and professor José Manuel Losada. According to Cultural myth criticism, the studies of myth must understand and explain a global and imaginary reality and be able to better understand contemporary culture.<br>
    
    Myth is an oral, symbolic, evolutionary and apparently simple account (in the sense of a tale, a diegesis, or a series of narrative and representative actions) of an extraordinary experience or event with a transcendental and personal referent that shows social classification. Considered, in principle, as bereft of historical testimony, myth is composed by a series of constant or invariable cultural semantic elements which can be reduced to themes, and is endowed with a conflictive (it invariably contains a trial or ordeal), functional character (understood as the transmission of common values and beliefs, and the provision of factual schemata of rites and actions) and etiological nature (expressing in some way a particular or universal cosmogony or eschatology).<br>
    
    Scholars in other fields use the term myth in varied ways.[17][18][19] In a broad sense, the word can refer to any traditional story,[20][21][22] popular misconception or imaginary entity.<br>
    
    However, while myth and other folklore genres may overlap, myth is often thought to differ from genres such as legend and folktale in that neither are considered to be sacred narratives.[24][25] Some kinds of folktales, such as fairy stories, are not considered true by anyone, and may be seen as distinct from myths for this reason.[26][27][28] Main characters in myths are usually gods, demigods or supernatural humans,[7][2][3] while legends generally feature humans as their main characters.[7][4] However, many exceptions or combinations exist, as in the Iliad, Odyssey and Aeneid.[29][30] Moreover, as stories spread between cultures or as faiths change, myths can come to be considered folktales, their divine characters recast as either as humans or demihumans such as giants, elves and faeries.[2][31][32] Conversely, historical and literary material may acquire mythological qualities over time. For example, the Matter of Britain (the legendary history of Great Britain, especially those focused on King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table)[33] and the Matter of France, seem distantly to originate in historical events of the 5th and 8th-centuries respectively, and became mythologised over the following centuries.<br>
    
    In colloquial use, the word myth can also be used of a collectively held belief that has no basis in fact, or any false story.[34] This usage, which is often pejorative,[35] arose from labelling the religious myths and beliefs of other cultures as incorrect, but it has spread to cover non-religious beliefs as well.<br>
    
    However, as commonly used by folklorists and academics in other relevant fields, such as anthropology, the term myth has no implication whether the narrative may be understood as true or otherwise.[37] Among biblical scholars of both the Old and New Testament, the word "myth" has a technical meaning, in that it usually refers to "describe the actions of the other‐worldly in terms of this world" such as the Creation and the Fall.</p>
